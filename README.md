# commentariat
Quickly generate comments on a WordPress blog for testing

## How to Use

- Install and activate this plugin.
- You'll find a new menu item at wp-admin > Tools > Commentariat
- Use the new tool to generate new comments or delete ALL the comments on a site
- I've been seeing about 25 seconds to generate 500 comments and less than 1 second to delete them.
